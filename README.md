# 🎓 Student Registration System – C# Layered Architecture Project

This is a simple yet structured Student Registration System developed using C# with a **layered (n-tier) architecture** approach in **Visual Studio Code**. The project demonstrates how to manage students and courses using a clean separation of responsibilities between layers.

## 📁 Project Structure (Layered Architecture)

- **Core Layer**: Contains entities and shared interfaces (e.g., `Student`, `Course`).
- **Data/Repository Layer**: Handles data access logic and in-memory or EF-based storage.
- **Business Layer (Service)**: Contains business rules and logic (e.g., validation, relations).
- **Presentation Layer (Console or UI)**: Provides a simple interface to interact with the system.
